        <span>  According to the Daily Reference Intakes (DRIs) established by the Japanese Dietetic Association (JDA), the ideal amount of proteins that have to be taken daily is located between 13% and 20% of the total amount of calories. According to the JDA, such an amount aims to prevent the progression of life-style related deseases.</span>

            <ul>
            <li>Proteins are considered as a positive nutrient. Then, the scoring for protein is increasing as long as the amount of proteins is significant.</li>
            <li>A product with an amount of proteins entering in the lower bound defined by the JDA (i.e. the kcal equivalent of proteins represent at least 13% of the total calories of the product), is credited with a grade of at least 75/100 for the proteins scoring section.  <br>
                </li>
            <li>A product with an amount of proteins greater than or equal to the upper bound defined by the JDA (i.e. the kcal equivalent of proteins represent at least 20% of the total calories of the product), is credited with a grade of at least 99/100 for the proteins scoring section.<br>
